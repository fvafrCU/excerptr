Installation
============

Unix
----
Install `the rPython package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rPython>`_, 
see file `INSTALL <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rPython/INSTALL>`_ there.

Then install *excerptr* from 
`CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/package=excerptr>`_:

.. code:: R

    install.packages("excerptr")

Windows
-------
*excerptr* is a unix-only package since one of it's dependencies, *rPython*, is.
Since *rPython* has a non-CRAN work around - *rPython-win* -, and the *excerptr* code
itself does not make any asumptions about your operating system, you can use
*excerptr* on windows with *rPython-win*.
So:

Install `rPython-win <https://github.com/cjgb/rPython-win>`_
(follow the instructions at 
`https://cran.r-project.org/package=rPython/INSTALL <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rPython/INSTALL>`_
).

Then follow the instructions given at
`excerptr on github <https://github.com/fvafrCU/excerptr>`_ (you basically
remove the restriction to unix from *excerptr*'s DESCRIPTION).
