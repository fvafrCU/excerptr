# Install rPython-win
Install rPython-win following 
[these instructions](https://github.com/cjgb/rPython-win)
with the current (May 2017) python setup at fvafr. 
Assuming you have installed R and Rtools from the software shop, you can run:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(readLines(file.path("codes", "fva_install_rpython-win.R")), sep = "\n")
```
To date you need to use R 3.2.5 for this to work since our Rtools version is out
of date and does not work for our current R installation. 
Run "C:\Program Files\R\R-3.2.5\bin\x64\Rgui.exe" from a command prompt, set the 
R version used by RStudio to 3.2.5 or 
navigate to "C:\Program Files\R\R-3.2.5\bin\x64" and start Rgui.exe.
